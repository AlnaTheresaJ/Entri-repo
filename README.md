# Entri-repo
This repository contains a mini-project on Employee Layoffs Analysis, in which I clean and preprocess a dataset using Excel, and then build an interactive dashboard in Power BI. The goal is to explore layoffs data and surface insights such as trends, department impact, and patterns in layoff activity.
Data Cleaning Process : 
Used Excel for cleaning tasks: removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing formats.
Ensured data consistency, corrected errors, and prepared the data for visualization.
