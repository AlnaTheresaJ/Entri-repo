Data cleaning using Excel,
Dashboard creation using Power Bi
This repository contains a mini-project on Employee Layoffs Analysis, in which I clean and preprocess a dataset using Excel, and then build an interactive dashboard in Power BI. The goal is to explore layoffs data and surface insights such as trends, department impact, and patterns in layoff activity.
